Hi there! 👋 I'm Harsh
I’m a final-year Bachelor of Technology student at Hi-Tech Institute of Engineering & Technology, expected to graduate in 2025. Passionate about web development and UI/UX design, I enjoy crafting user-friendly interfaces and building applications that solve real-world problems.

👨‍💻 My Skills
Frontend: React.js, ShadCN UI, GSAP (animations), HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Appwrite, MySQL
Tools & Libraries: Locomotive.js, Axios, Zod, Yup, useFormik, AJAX, jQuery
Others: RESTful APIs, Git, GitHub Actions,  WordPress (themes and plugins)

🌱 Current Projects

🔍 Interests
I’m eager to continue exploring Spring, React, and JavaScript frameworks while enhancing my backend skills with Appwrite. I’m also looking forward to working on open-source projects to deepen my understanding and contribute to the developer community.

💼 Experience
I’ve had hands-on experience in creating CRUD applications, developing RESTful APIs, and implementing AJAX for dynamic data handling. During my internships and projects, I’ve worked with diverse teams, managed client requirements, and delivered user-centered solutions.
